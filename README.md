## ⭐ Featured Project

### ⌚ Watch Price & Value Regression Analysis  
**Status:** In progress

A regression-based study analyzing the factors that influence the price of wristwatches and the likelihood that a watch maintains or increases its value over time.

The project investigates how different attributes contribute to price formation and long-term value retention, distinguishing perceived value from statistically measurable effects.

**Key aspects analyzed:**
- Brand positioning and market reputation  
- Movement type (manual, automatic, quartz)  
- Materials and case composition  
- Technical features and complications  
- Scarcity and production volume  
- Release year and market evolution  

**Main objectives:**
- Identify which attributes significantly impact initial market price  
- Separate price-driving factors from value-preserving factors  
- Provide data-driven insights for buyers, collectors, and investors
